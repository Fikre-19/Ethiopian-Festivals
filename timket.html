    ጥምቀት is one of the most significant and colorful religious festivals in Ethiopia, celebrated
     by Ethiopian Orthodox Christians. It commemorates the baptism of Jesus Christ in the Jordan River by 
     John the Baptist. The festival typically celebrated on 10th of Tir in ethiopian calander (or January 20th
    during a leap year) and lasts for three days.

     <h3>Outfits</h3>  
     <p class="pl">The outfits worn during the Timket festival in Ethiopia are deeply rooted in cultural and religious traditions.
         The attire is typically white, symbolizing purity and holiness, and it reflects both the religious significance of the event 
         and Ethiopian cultural identity. </p>

    <h4>Foods</h4>
        <p class="pla">
    Ethiopian meals, especially during Timket, are usually communal, with families and friends gathering
    around a large platter. The meal is shared, with everyone using pieces of injera to pick up the 
    different dishes. One of my favorite food to eat during this holiday is <b>Beyaynetu</b> is a 
    vegetarian platter that features a variety of lentils, pulses, and vegetable stews. Each item 
    is placed on top of injera, creating a colorful and nutritious spread. Common components 
    include misir wat (spiced lentils), shiro (a chickpea or broad bean stew), and various sautéed
    or spiced vegetables.</p>

    <h4>Drinks</h4>
    <p class="pla">
        Tej is a traditional Ethiopian honey wine, often homemade, and served during special occasions 
        like Timket. It has a sweet, slightly tangy flavor and is usually sipped from small glasses.</p>

    <p class="pla">
        Keribo is a traditional Ethiopian food specially prepared for children, particularly during 
        fasting periods when adults abstain from animal products. Keribo is a simple yet nutritious
        dish made from roasted barley flour, and it can be prepared in various ways depending on the 
        ingredients available and the child's preference.</p>
