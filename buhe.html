    ቡሄ is a traditional Ethiopian festival celebrated on Nähase 13 in Ethiopian calender(August 19), known 
    for its unique cultural rituals and community spirit. The festival is particularly popular among 
    children, who play a central role in its observance. The main activity associated with Buhe is the
    singing of songs, known as "Hoya Hoye," by groups of boys who go from house to house. These songs 
    are accompanied by rhythmic clapping and the beating of sticks, creating a lively and festive
    atmosphere. The children receive gifts, typically in the form of fresh bread called "mulmul" 
    or small amounts of money, as a token of appreciation for their performances.
