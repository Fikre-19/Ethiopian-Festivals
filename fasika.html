 <p>
    Fasika is the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church's celebration of Easter, a major religious 
    holiday in Ethiopia. It marks the resurrection of Jesus Christ and is one of the most significant
    festivals in the Ethiopian Orthodox calendar. The celebration of Fasika is deeply rooted in ancient 
    Christian traditions and carries significant cultural and spiritual importance. The lead-up to Fasika
    involves an extended period of fasting, known as Lent (Hudade or Abiy Tsom), which lasts for 55 days. 
    During this period, devout Christians abstain from eating meat, dairy products, and other animal-derived 
    foods. The fasting period is one of the most stringent and is taken very seriously by followers of the
    Ethiopian Orthodox Church.

     <h3>Outfits</h3>  
     <p class="pl">
        During Fasika, Ethiopians wear traditional white outfits symbolizing purity and spiritual 
        renewal. Men typically wear a shamma or gabi, handwoven white cotton cloths draped over the shoulders,
        while women don a habesha kemis, a long white dress with colorful embroidery, paired with a netela
        shawl. Both men and women often accessorize with traditional Ethiopian jewelry. The outfits reflect
        the solemnity and joy of the occasion, blending religious observance with cultural pride.</p>

       <h4>Foods</h4>
       <p class="pla">
        <b> Genfo</b> is a traditional Ethiopian dish, often enjoyed as a breakfast or a ceremonial
        food, particularly during special occasions and religious fasting periods. Genfo is
        a type of thick porridge, primarily made from barley or wheat flour, and its 
        preparation and serving methods reflect Ethiopia's deep culinary traditions. 
        Traditionally, the well in the center of the Genfo is filled with a generous amount 
        of niter kibbeh, which is spiced clarified butter, and sometimes berbere (a blend of 
        chili and spices) is added for heat. The butter melts into the porridge, creating a 
        rich, flavorful dish. Genfo is typically eaten by tearing off pieces and dipping them 
        into the butter and spice mixture.
